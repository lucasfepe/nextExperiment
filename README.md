# 🌟 Luke Ferrari's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Luke Ferrari, a software developer. This portfolio is built using **Next.js** and includes:

- 🪝 Custom hooks & wrapper components
- 🛠 ESLint enforcement with Husky
- 🔄 State lifting & component-first structure
- 🧑‍💻 GitHub API integration
- 🎨 3D animations using CSS stacking contexts, react portals, and awareness of fixed-positioned elements

The project is well-structured with folders for **utils, constants, components, styles, hooks**, and uses **CSS modules** for scoped styling.
